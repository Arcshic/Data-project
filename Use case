Main Purpose: 
  1.Analysing the relationship between the house price and other factors.
  2.Completing the system which can generate the proper house price by inputing other factors.

Data size: 
  13580 records
  314 suburbs 
  33 concils
  Date from Jan 2016 to sep 2017

Methods:
  1.Data preparation.
  2.Analysing the difference of price between concils (maybe suburbs).
  3.Analysing the trend of price from Jan 2016 to Sep 2017 (may see the difference of trend between concils).
  4.Choosing 3 concils to analyse the relationship between house price and other factors(like bathroom,bedroom,buliding area).
  5.Trying to build system to generate price by machine learning.

Ideas:
  1.Because there are too many suburbs (314), the report may focus on the difference between concils instead of suburbs.
  2.Some factors may not have strong relationships between price, so I will consider if they should be put in system.
  3.I want to create a map by using lattitude & longtitude.
  4.House price may need to be divided by building area & landsize.
